<p>&quot;His thick clothes were still wet, though most of the mud had dried. Seized so roughly, he wasn’t sure if they had even collected all his materials. A week and a half chasing down a lead on a thought-to-be-mythical ingredient. Not an illegal practice in his mind—he had always believed that the pursuit of knowledge, even in dangerous places, was justified. He was not one to break laws. But surely, if the land had been restricted by the local ----- authorities, they wouldn’t have responded this way. His whole life, simple warnings and an escort had been more than enough.</p>
<p>His mind flashed back to when he’d first heard the stories—the whispers that had set him on this path. The Legendary --- Chef, a figure of myth whose culinary feats were said to have swayed kings and kingdoms. For years, he’d told himself it was just a story—until the clues started coming together.</p>
<p>The sound of stone cobbles beneath heavy boots and the shuddering of wooden chairs on the floor’s dusty surface snapped the --- back to the present as he was roughly placed in a chair.</p>
<p>Here, in this dungeon, all the excitement of those discoveries seemed distant, like a lifetime ago. Every lead, every whisper, felt trivial now. It was those very stories that had brought him here, bound. Maybe he&#39;d finally pushed too far, asked questions no one else dared. The chains, the dungeon—the interrogations—now seemed almost like confirmation that the chef was no mere tale.</p>
<p>A bitter realization crept over him: Was his future to be defined by these interrogations, by what the empire wanted from him? Or could his destiny still be shaped by his hands, by the skills he had honed and the legacy he hoped to inherit?</p>
<p>The faint flicker of lantern light seeped through the fabric, catching the dull metal of the guards&#39; chainmail as they shifted around him. Their steps faltered, then stilled entirely, the air thickening as they closed in. He could feel their eyes on him, the bag remained, suffocating the world beyond it. The bag on his head shifted, and in that moment, without a word, it was yanked off.&quot;</p>

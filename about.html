  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my portfolio—a space where creative exploration, digital preservation, and community-driven innovation converge.</p>
  
  <p>I’m a creative technologist dedicated to transforming ideas into dynamic experiences using tools like Blender, Unreal Engine, and Python. My journey began with CSVmaker, my first software release, which laid the groundwork for developing systems that efficiently blend data and design.</p>
  
  <p>For example, at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OfficalComicBookNews">OfficialComicBookNews</a>, I built a reusable system that dynamically loads comic images and descriptions from CSV files into Unreal Engine. This approach allows for a constantly refreshed showcase of visual storytelling—all powered by a single, retextured comic object that cycles through animated presentations.</p>
  
  <p>Alongside these projects, I’m deeply involved in archival and preservation efforts. Some of my archival and video tests can be found on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Dnf_Jeff">Dnf_Jeff</a>, where I document experiments in video, VFX, and environment design.</p>
  
  <p>My work is also informed by a long-standing habit of systematic note planning and writing, ensuring that every project is as thoughtfully curated as it is innovative.</p>
  
  <p>This site is not a “let’s talk” message but rather a celebration of projects that push the boundaries of digital expression and community collaboration. It’s about preserving creative legacies, sharing compelling ideas, and uplifting fellow creators along the way.</p>
  
  <p>Thank you for exploring my world of ideas and digital craftsmanship.</p>
